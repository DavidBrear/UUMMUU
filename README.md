UUMMUU Web Search Engine
========================

UUMMUU is the search engine product of my *2007-2008* senior year. This
project was intended to crawl all of the Christopher Newport University
[(CNU)](http://cnu.edu) website and demonstrate the full text searching
capabilities of a web search engine while attempting to deduce word
importance based on CSS definitions.
This code is meant solely as a representation of the project and is not
intended for any production use.
